// Data Types and Variables

/* Data Types:
undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number, and object
String: Any 'string', or combination, of text.
Undefined: Anything not defined; for example, a variable with no assigned value.
Null: Nothing.
Boolean: True or False
Symbol: An immutable, primitive value that is unique (more on that later).
Number: An integer
Object: Something that can store a lot of key-value pairs (again, more later).
*/

/* Variables:
Variables are basically labels that point to some data. They let us store and
manipulate data in a dynamic way. It's almost like a box, and you can fill that
box with anything you want.
*/

// 'var' can be used within the whole program
var myName = 'Dakota'

// once defined, it can then later be changed like so:
myName = 'Bowman'

// 'let' can only be used in the scope in which it was defined
let ourName = 'Bowman Flooring Company'

// 'const' is a variable that cannot be changed
const pi = '3.14'
